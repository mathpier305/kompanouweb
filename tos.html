The App will not share user information with any third parties without the user’s explicit consent.</p>

<h3>User Conduct</h3>
<p>Users are responsible for their conduct while using the App. Users must not use the App for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the App. Users must not use the App to harass, intimidate, or threaten other users.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>The App reserves the right to terminate a user’s access to the App at any time, without notice, for any reason. Upon termination, all provisions of this Policy that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event shall the App be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the App or its content, even if the App has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
